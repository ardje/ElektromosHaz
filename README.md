# Backgrounds:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SXtGIx0x5w (inverter overloads by victron)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BOAbYmP1bA (generator optimization)

# Lessons learned from background
For loads with a cosinus of 0.7, the inverter has to support 200% of that load.

# Requirements
* Have power for living area
* Always have working power for the building area
* The building area is about 30..70m distance
* Have both: working solutions (diesel generator) and optimisation solutions (diesel to battery and PV)
* Try to have independence of failures

# Available equipment at least
* 6xMPII 48/5000/70
* 3xLynx Distribution
* 1x Cerbo GX

# Specs of MPII 4/5000/70
* Full sustained power at 40C: 16A @ 230V (3.7kW)
* 30m power: 20A @ 230V (5kW)
* Max power: 39A @ 230V for 0.5s (9kW) before overload shutdown


# Solutions
* Have 2 separate sites with diesel generator (working solution). Very very expensive
* Have 2 separate sites with diesel generator and battery storage for power optimazation.
* Have 2 seperate sites with one diesel generator feeding one and have that site feed the other site.
* Have 1 big site with one diesel generator.

# Solution
## 2 seperate sites with one diesel generator
